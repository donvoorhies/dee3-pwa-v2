# dee3-pwa-v2 (second prototype/trial-run)
The dee3 web-app source-code; an quick, simple way to make (via Mixcloud's embedded player and playlist) a web-app that one can link to and showcase one's mixes.
Thanks goes to Dean Hume (https://github.com/deanhume/Service-Worker-Offline) and Tal Ater for his UpUp-library (https://www.talater.com/upup/) for inspiration...
